### Code's purpose
The code was made for fun purpose. You can see [Nick White](https://www.youtube.com/c/NickWhite) [Reacting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bTVvZ7Ed3M) to this code. 

### Contribution ❓
Well I don't really think the code needs more things. But if you want to be part of this joke, why not❔

- Add extra methods related to Nick White
- Be creative, you can change `NickWhite.get_freaky` function to something more fun.
  I was thinking of something like this `def get_freaky(self, woman: Woman) -> None`, and then checking if the girl is an OF model or not.
